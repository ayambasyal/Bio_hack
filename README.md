# Bio_hack
 Biohackathon-2022

 Prerequisites to run the code:
 1. Have python and gcc/mingw installed and have them in PATH
 2. Have biopython and blast installed and have them in PATH(Have the bin folder itself if possible)*at your own risk

steps to run the pipeline
 1. Choose the complete genome of your choice in FASTA format and keep it in the project directory as "input.fasta"
 2. run the source executable file
 3. Check the blast_output3 for all data, blast_output4 for titles of the related toxin and blast_output5 for evalues in order of identical nature

How to try ?
 1. there are complete genome sequence of a few bacteria in data-genome folder which can be copied outside as "input.fasta"
 2. follow the steps of pipeline to get the desired result 

Major libraries used

 1. Blast
    Manual for Blast - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/
 2. pandas for preparing database
    pandas documentation - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
